# Vulnerability Assessment
Vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing security vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications. Common software tools used for vulnerability assessment include:

1. Nessus: A widely used vulnerability scanner that identifies security issues in networks, hosts, and web applications.
2. OpenVAS: An open-source vulnerability scanner that detects security vulnerabilities in networks and systems.
3. Qualys: A cloud-based vulnerability management platform that provides continuous monitoring and assessment of security risks.
4. Nmap
5. Burp Suite: A web vulnerability scanner and security testing tool used for identifying vulnerabilities in web applications.

## CVEs Vs CWEs

### CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration):
- CWE is a community-developed list of common software weaknesses and security issues.
- CWE focuses on identifying and describing the root causes of vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.
- Examples of CWE entries include CWE-119 (Buffer Errors), CWE-89 (SQL Injection), and CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting).

### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):
- CVE is a standardized framework used to uniquely identify and reference publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
- CVE focuses on providing unique identifiers for vulnerabilities to facilitate communication, tracking, and prioritization of security issues.
- Examples of CVE entries include CVE-2021-3456 (a vulnerability in a specific software product) and CVE-2020-12345 (a vulnerability in a specific network protocol).

In summary, CWE categorizes and describes common software weaknesses, while CVE uniquely identifies and references specific vulnerabilities.

# Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
Here are the steps of the vulnerability life cycle process:

1. Creating a baseline: In this phase, we look at critical assets, identify them, and prioritize them to create a good baseline for vulnerability management.
2. The assessment: This is a critical phase of vulnerability management. What we do, as security professionals, is identify and know the vulnerabilities within our infrastructure.
3. Risk assessment: All we're doing here is measuring or summarizing the vulnerability and the risk level – some systems may be at a higher risk level than others. Again, it depends on what their function is and who is operating them.
4. Remediation: Remediation is the process of fixing those vulnerabilities based on the risk assessment. We need to know which ones are the most important and then tackle them accordingly.
5. Verification: We take this step to make sure we've fixed the issue. It allows the security team to check whether all the phases we've done previously have been followed and if the identified vulnerabilities have been fixed.
6. Monitoring: Regular monitoring needs to be performed to help you maintain and always have the lastest updates. This is because a new update will have you create a new baseline where new threats will come out daily. So, we're going to continue monitoring.

# Vulnerability Classification

## Overview
Not all vulnerabilities are equal. This guide outlines common vulnerability types, providing a basis for understanding detection and remediation.

---

### 1. **Misconfigurations**
   - **Description**: Simple yet common errors where configurations make systems insecure.
   - **Examples**: World-writable permissions on a web directory.
   - **Risks**: Often exploited due to unchecked configurations; scanners frequently detect these.

### 2. **Default Credentials and Configurations**
   - **Description**: Default settings left unchanged post-installation, typically insecure.
   - **Examples**: Leaving default admin passwords unchanged.
   - **Best Practice**: Modify these to secure settings upon setup.

### 3. **Missing Patches and Updates**
   - **Description**: Failing to update software, leaving it vulnerable to known exploits.
   - **Example**: Equifax breach due to an unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability.
   - **Impact**: Exploited by threat actors for access; critical for older infrastructure like SCADA systems.

### 4. **Application and Design Flaws**
   - **Description**: Coding errors that introduce vulnerabilities in applications.
   - **Examples**: SQL injection, insufficient input validation.
   - **Detection Tools**: SAST and DAST scanners to identify issues in code and during runtime.

### 5. **Cloud Vulnerabilities**
   - **Description**: Issues specific to cloud environments.
   - **Examples**: Publicly accessible AWS S3 buckets or Azure misconfigurations.
   - **Note**: Classified separately due to the unique nature of cloud environments.

### 6. **Open Services**
   - **Description**: Services left open, often unintentionally, exposing systems to risks.
   - **Examples**: FTP with anonymous login, SSH left open on critical servers.
   - **Tools**: Use `nmap` or `netstat` to identify open services and reduce attack surface.

### 7. **Buffer Overflows**
   - **Description**: Occurs when data exceeds buffer memory, potentially allowing code injection.
   - **Example**: "Smashing the stack for fun and profit" technique.
   - **Impact**: Can lead to system crashes or malicious code execution.

---

## Tools and Techniques
- **Scanners**: Nessus, OpenVAS for general vulnerabilities; specialized SAST/DAST for application-specific flaws.
- **Command-Line**: `nmap` and `netstat` for identifying open services on machines.

## Summary
Understanding these vulnerability types aids in prioritizing fixes and using appropriate tools. Proper configurations, regular updates, and targeted scanning are essential to secure an environment effectively.


# Vulnerability Assessment Types
1. Active assessments: These are typically where we use network scanners to scan the network to identify the hosts, any vulnerabilities on those hosts, all the different nodes, and the services – anything that's on the network. Active network scanners can reduce the intrusiveness of the checks that they perform. So, you can make them extremely loud, or extremely quiet, or stealthy, if you will.

2. Passive assessments: This is where we sniff the traffic. So, we're not going after a specific target – we're just looking at the traffic to see if we can identify active systems, services, or applications, and then try to determine the vulnerabilities present. Now, because we're sniffing the traffic, we should also be able to get a list of users who are currently on the network.

3. External Assessment:
- This assessment simulates attacks from outside the organization's network, such as from the internet or other external sources.
- Common targets for external assessments include external-facing websites, web applications, email servers, remote access services (e.g., VPN), and publicly accessible infrastructure.
- The goal of an external assessment is to identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses that could be exploited by external attackers to gain unauthorized access to the organization's systems or data.

4. Internal Assessment:
- This assessment simulates attacks that originate from within the organization's network, such as from a compromised employee device or an insider threat.
- Common targets for internal assessments include internal servers, workstations, databases, file shares, and other resources accessible to authenticated users within the organization's network.
- The goal of an internal assessment is to identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses that could be exploited by insider threats, compromised accounts, or unauthorized users with access to the internal network.

5. Host-based assessments: Here, we're going to do a configuration-level check at each of the host machines, whether they're a server or a desktop. The type of thing I want to look at includes whether I can get a hold of a registry and see if it has been incorrectly configured, as well as any file permissions and software configuration issues.

6. Network assessments: This shows you vulnerabilities such as unnecessary services, weak authentication, and missing patches on your desktops, laptops, servers, and the network devices themselves. Is the interface for your switch through HTTP? Is it open? What's authentication mechanism is used? Is there weak encryption?

7. Application assessments: Here, we're looking at apps that are installed everywhere. When I say apps, I'm not just referencing apps on workstations. SQL, Exchange, SharePoint, and WordPress are all examples of apps. Anything that loads up on the servers is an app and we must make sure it has been patched and configured correctly and is up to date.

8. Wireless network assessments: It encompasses identifying active networks, assessing encryption protocols, detecting rogue access points, and conducting risk analysis to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of wireless communications.

# Vulnerability Assessment Models and Tools

## Types of vulnerability assessment solutions
There are four types of vulnerability assessment solutions. They are as follows:

1. Product-based solutions:
- These are software tools or appliances installed within your network.
- They scan for vulnerabilities on your systems and networks.
- Examples include vulnerability scanners like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Qualys.

2. Service-based solutions:
- These are vulnerability assessment services provided by third-party vendors or consultants.
- They may be hosted externally or within your organization's infrastructure.
- They offer expertise and resources for vulnerability assessment without the need for internal tools or personnel.

3. Tree-based solutions:
- These are hybrid solutions that use different scanners for different types of systems or services.
- For example, one scanner may be used for Windows systems, another for databases, and another for web servers.
- This approach ensures comprehensive vulnerability assessment across diverse environments.

4. Inference-based solutions:
- These solutions start by identifying all protocols and services present on each machine.
- They then use this information to infer potential vulnerabilities based on known issues associated with specific services.
- Inference-based solutions provide a systematic approach to identifying and testing vulnerabilities based on discovered services and protocols.

## Types of vulnerability assessment Tools
1. Host-Based Tools: they focus on identifying vulnerabilities and misconfigurations on individual systems or hosts. They scan the operating system, installed software, configurations, and file systems for security weaknesses. Examples include OpenVAS, Nessus, and Qualys.
   
2. Depth Assessment Tools: Depth assessment tools perform thorough examinations of specific components or layers within an environment to uncover vulnerabilities that may be overlooked by traditional scanning methods. These tools often focus on deep inspection of network protocols, application logic, or system interactions to identify subtle vulnerabilities. Examples include specialized network protocol analyzers and application security testing tools.

3. Application Layer Tools: Application layer vulnerability assessment tools focus on identifying vulnerabilities specific to web applications, APIs, and other software applications. They analyze application code, input validation mechanisms, authentication mechanisms, and session management to uncover vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references (IDOR).

4. Mobile Tools: Mobile vulnerability assessment tools are specifically designed to assess the security of mobile applications and mobile device configurations. They analyze mobile application binaries, communication protocols, storage mechanisms, and device settings to identify vulnerabilities and privacy risks unique to mobile platforms. Examples include MobSF (Mobile Security Framework), OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide, and AppScan Mobile Analyzer.

5. Location and Data Examination Tools:
- Cluster-Based Scanners: Cluster-based scanners are implemented by distributing the scanning workload across multiple nodes in a cluster or grid. Each node in the cluster performs a portion of the scanning tasks, allowing for parallel processing and efficient analysis of large datasets and complex environments.
  + Cluster-based scanners are typically implemented using multiple physical or virtual machines configured to operate as nodes in a cluster.
  + Each node in the cluster runs scanning software or agents that perform vulnerability assessments on a portion of the target environment.
  + The nodes communicate with each other to distribute the scanning workload, coordinate tasks, and aggregate results.
  + The cluster may be set up on-premises within an organization's data center or deployed in a cloud environment for scalability and flexibility.

- Proxy-Based Scanners: Proxy-based scanners are implemented by intercepting and inspecting network traffic between clients and servers. They act as intermediaries between clients and servers, allowing them to analyze network traffic in real-time for vulnerabilities, malware, and malicious activities. This interception and analysis occur transparently to users and applications, providing continuous monitoring and protection of network communications.
  + Implemented using specialized hardware appliances or software applications installed on dedicated servers or virtual machines.
  + May be deployed at key points in the network infrastructure, such as at the perimeter firewall, within a demilitarized zone (DMZ), or at strategic network chokepoints.

- Network-Based Scanners: Network-based scanners scan network devices, protocols, and services to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. They analyze network traffic, packet payloads, and device configurations to detect security weaknesses such as open ports, outdated software, and weak encryption. Network-based scanners operate at the network layer and are typically deployed as standalone appliances or software tools.

- Agent-Based Scanners: Agent-based scanners deploy lightweight software agents on individual systems or devices to perform continuous monitoring and assessment. These agents collect data on system configurations, software installations, and user activities to identify vulnerabilities and security events in real-time. Agent-based scanners provide visibility into the security posture of endpoints and can be particularly useful in environments with dynamic or distributed infrastructure.
