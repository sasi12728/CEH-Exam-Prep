Mobile devices have multiple entry points for attackers due to their extensive functionality and connectivity.

### Key Attack Surfaces
1. **Operating Systems**:
   - Vulnerable to outdated patches.
   - Regular updates are essential to address security flaws.
2. **Applications**:
   - Third-party or malicious apps can exploit devices.
   - Even official app stores occasionally host compromised apps.
3. **Bluetooth**:
   - Susceptible to attacks like Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing, Bluebugging, and BlueBorne.
   - Older specifications lack encryption and authentication.
4. **Wi-Fi**:
   - Subject to common wireless threats (e.g., Evil Twin, Honeypot attacks).
   - Devices on public Wi-Fi are particularly vulnerable.
5. **Telco (Cellular Networks)**:
   - Outdated protocols like SS7 allow attackers to eavesdrop on calls, intercept messages, and perform billing fraud.
6. **Web Browsing**:
   - Exposed to client-side attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), drive-by downloads, and clickjacking.


## Threats and Vulnerabilities
### Malware
- **Overview**: Malware targets all devices, including mobile.
- **Examples**: Malicious APKs, spyware apps.
- **Prevention**: Regular updates, antivirus tools, and avoiding third-party app stores.
