# Malware Concepts and Components

## What is Malware?

- **Malware** is short for "malicious software." It refers to any software that performs harmful actions on a computer system or network. 
- It can take various forms, and while all viruses are malware, not all malware are viruses.

## Common Types of Malware

- **Trojan**: Appears innocuous or even useful but contains hidden malicious code (e.g., like a Tootsie Pop with smallpox inside).
- **Virus**: A malicious program that spreads through human interaction (e.g., email attachments, USB drives). It spreads when shared with others.
- **Worm**: Similar to viruses but can propagate itself without human interaction. Worms often exploit vulnerabilities like remote code execution (RCE).
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts a victim's data and demands payment (often in Bitcoin) for decryption. Example: WannaCry.
- **Adware**: Software that displays unwanted advertisements, often gathering data on your habits. It may not be strictly malicious but is often annoying and invasive.
- **Spyware**: Gathers information about users without consent, typically for advertising purposes.

## Malware Components

- **Downloader**: A non-malicious program that downloads harmful files from the internet.
- **Dropper**: Contains malicious code and installs malware onto the target system.
- **Obfuscator**: Makes the malware code unreadable to prevent detection by security systems.
- **Cryptor**: Encrypts malware code to prevent analysis; the code must be decrypted to understand its function.
- **Payload**: The actual malicious action the malware carries out (e.g., encrypting files, exfiltrating data).
- **Exploit**: A known vulnerability in software that malware may use to spread (e.g., EternalBlue used by WannaCry).

## Common Malware Propagation Methods

1. **Email Attachments**: A common way for malware to spread is via malicious email attachments or links.
2. **Software Installations from Untrusted Sources**: Downloading software from torrents or other untrusted sources can lead to malware infections.
3. **Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities**: Malware can use known vulnerabilities in software to spread automatically (e.g., EternalBlue in WannaCry).

## Real-World Malware Examples

- **Ransomware**: Targets industries like healthcare and education. The shift from encrypting files to exfiltrating data and threatening to release it on the dark web is becoming more common.
- **Famous Malware**: Examples include BlackEnergy, Cryptolockers, and the Equation Group. A GitHub repository, "thezoo," hosts a variety of real-world malware samples for analysis (e.g., Fancy Bear, Petya, WannaCry).

## Key Takeaways

- **Malware is diverse**, with many different types, each with its own methods of propagation and goals.
- **Components like payloads, exploits, and obfuscation techniques** are common across many types of malware.
- Understanding how malware spreads and functions is critical for detection and prevention.

# Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

## Overview
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, persistent, and malicious cyber threats typically orchestrated by well-organized groups. These groups are highly skilled and have specific objectives such as data exfiltration, espionage, or financial gain.

### Key Characteristics of APTs
- **Advanced**: High-level skills and custom exploits are often used.
- **Persistent**: They maintain long-term access to the target systems.
- **Threat**: Their goal is to execute malicious activities without being detected.

   - Maintaining long-term access through various persistence techniques.

### 5. **Exfiltration**
   - Gathering and transferring sensitive information to external systems controlled by the attackers.

### 6. **Cleanup**
   - Covering tracks by erasing log files and removing evidence of the intrusion.

## Final Thoughts
APTs are a significant threat due to their sophisticated and patient nature. Understanding their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) is crucial for defending against these highly skilled threat actors.

# Trojan

## What is a Trojan?
A Trojan is a type of malware that masquerades as legitimate software but contains a malicious payload. The name is derived from the Greek myth of the Trojan Horse, where enemies hid inside to infiltrate the city. In the case of Trojans, the "horse" is digital.

- **Function**: Malicious software disguised as a legitimate program to trick users into installing it.
- **Propagation**: Does not self-replicate; relies on social engineering to spread.
- **Example**: Downloaders & Droppers => Trojan.Downloader.
- In simple words, I will create a game which when executed by the user creates a reverse shell to my C2 server and then upload this game to a forum and boom!

## Downloaders & Droppers
In the context of cybersecurity and malware, the terms "dropper" and "downloader" refer to different types of malicious software designed to install other malware on a target system. Here's a brief explanation of the differences between them:

#### Dropper
- **Function**: A dropper is a type of malware designed to install another malicious payload on the victim's system. It typically carries the malicious payload within its own code.
- **Operation**: Once executed, the dropper extracts and installs the payload directly onto the system.
- **Payload Delivery**: The payload is usually embedded within the dropper itself, making it a self-contained malware delivery mechanism.

#### Downloader
- **Function**: A downloader is a type of malware that, upon execution, retrieves additional malicious software from the internet or another network location.
- **Operation**: The downloader contacts a remote server to download the additional malware, which it then installs on the system.
- **Payload Delivery**: Unlike droppers, downloaders do not contain the malicious payload initially; they fetch it from an external source after being executed.

#### Cryptors 
Cryptors are tools or components used to encrypt malicious payloads. The primary purpose of a cryptor is to obfuscate malware to evade detection by antivirus software and other security mechanisms. Cryptors work by transforming the code of the malware into a format that is not recognizable by signature-based detection methods. Once the encrypted payload reaches the target system, the cryptor decrypts it, allowing the malware to execute.


#### Key Differences
- **Embedded Payload**: Droppers contain the payload within themselves, while downloaders fetch the payload from an external location.
- **Network Activity**: Downloaders require network access to download the additional malware, whereas droppers do not necessarily need network access to deliver the payload.

### Types of Trojans:
- **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**
- **Mobile Trojans**
- **IoT Botnet Trojans**
- **Banking Trojans**
- **Denial of Service Trojans**
- **Backdoor Trojans**

## Purpose of Trojans
Trojans are used for a variety of malicious activities, including:
- **Disabling Firewalls/IDS** to gain deeper access.
- **Installing More Malware** as a prelude to further attacks like ransomware.
- **Establishing Command and Control (C2) communications** for remote control.
- **Spying** via keystroke logging, camera/audio hijacking, and browsing monitoring.
- **Blackmail/Extortion** based on sensitive activities.
- **Storage Theft** by using a victim's device to store malicious data.
- **Destruction** via "wipers" that erase data or disable the system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks or **botnet creation**.
- **Theft** of sensitive data (PII, PHI, financials).

## Deploying Trojans
Trojans can be deployed using various methods:
- **Dropper**: Initial benign malware that drops a more malicious payload.
- **Downloader**: Malware that downloads the second-stage Trojan from a remote source.
- **Rapper**: A program that contains a Trojan hidden within a seemingly harmless application.
- **Cryptor**: Malicious code encrypted to evade antivirus detection, which decrypts and executes the code at runtime.

### Key Deployment Methods:
1. **Dropper**: Malware that carries and installs a second-stage payload in a hidden directory.
2. **Downloader**: A seemingly safe program that downloads and installs the Trojan.
3. **Rapper**: An application that appears legitimate but hides a Trojan inside.
4. **Cryptor**: Obfuscates the Trojan code to bypass security defenses by encrypting the payload.

## Infection Methods
- Trojans are often spread through social engineering tactics, such as:
  - **Malicious Links**: Emails or websites that trick users into clicking a link or downloading an attachment.
  - **Macros**: Embedded in documents that, when opened, execute the malicious code.
  - **Fake Software**: Promises of free software that instead install a Trojan (e.g., fake media player or games).

## Example:
- A user might download a media player from an untrustworthy site. While the software appears harmless, it downloads a second-stage Trojan that gives the attacker control over the system.
- The attacker can gain access via Metasploit and execute commands with the user's privileges, potentially compromising the system.

## Conclusion
Trojans are versatile and can be used for various malicious purposes, ranging from data theft to system destruction. Proper security measures, including careful downloading and scrutinizing email attachments, can help prevent Trojan infections.


# Episode: Viruses and Worms

## Key Concepts

### Viruses vs. Worms
- **Virus**: Malicious software that attaches itself to a host file or program. It is self-replicating but requires human interaction (e.g., clicking on a file) to activate. Once activated, it spreads to other files.
  - Example: A virus spreads like a "zombie outbreak," infecting one file, which then infects others.

- **Worm**: A self-replicating malware that spreads independently through software vulnerabilities without requiring human interaction.
  - Example: Worms exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, propagate across systems, and find new systems to infect.

### Malware Goals
- Destruction of systems
- Cyber theft
- Hacktivism
- Chaos or "watching the world burn"

### Symptoms of Infection
- Poor system performance (e.g., high CPU usage, disk space depletion)
- Random system crashes
- Missing data or deleted files (e.g., documents)
  
### Virus Lifecycle
1. **Design**: Virus developers design and build new viruses.
2. **Replication**: The virus spreads to new files or systems.
3. **Launch**: The virus is executed when a user runs the infected file.
4. **Detection**: Security teams discover and analyze the virus.
5. **Incorporation**: Antivirus software updates to detect and protect against the new virus.
6. **Execution of Damage Routine**: Antivirus software removes the virus.

### Common Types of Viruses
- **Boot Sector Viruses**: Infect boot sectors of disks. Example: "Elk Cloner."
- **File-Level Viruses**: Spread through infected files. Example: Attachments or programs that carry viruses.
- **Macro Viruses**: Exploit application macros (e.g., Excel, Word) to run malicious code.
  - Example: The Melissa virus.
  
### Advanced Virus Types
- **Polymorphic Viruses**: Use encryption to change their signature, making them harder to detect.
  - Example: WannaCry, CryptoLocker.
- **Metamorphic Viruses**: Completely rewrite their code, avoiding detection by changing their structure.
- **Logic Bombs**: Malicious code that triggers on a specific event or time.
- **Ransomware**: A type of virus that encrypts files and demands a ransom to unlock them.
  - Example: "Holding someone for ransom" in a digital sense.


# Fileless Malware
In simple words, The malicious code being executed is being pushed into a memory space and never touching the disk.

## Characteristics
- **No Files on Disk**: Operates without leaving files on the hard drive.
- **Memory-Resident**: Persists in the system's RAM.
- **Leverages Legitimate Tools**: Uses built-in system tools like PowerShell, WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), and macros within Office documents.
- **Evades Detection**: Bypasses traditional antivirus solutions that scan for malicious files on disk.

## Attack Vectors
1. **Phishing Emails**: 
   - Contain malicious links or attachments that, when opened, execute fileless malware.
2. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**:

## Common Tactics
Attackers often obfuscate their code by modifying characters or using legitimate processes to avoid detection by security systems. This approach enables fileless malware to execute without leaving traces on disk, making it difficult for traditional security solutions to detect.

## Classification
### According to *Evidence*
- No file activity performed.
- Indirect file activity: Using legitimate files which are supposed to be on the system and modifying these files to run some malicious code but still in the memory space.
- Files required: This file is not malicious and doesn't raise red flags, but it reaches to the internet, grap a malicious file, and read the content of that file into the memory, so basically nothing malicious is touching the disk.

### According to *Entry Points*
- Exploits & Network-based
- Hardware: eg. Spreading through infected USB drives.
- Execution & Injection (macro based, script based, disk based).

## Types of Fileless Malware
Fileless malware can be categorized based on the techniques it employs and the components it targets. Here are the main types:

### 1. Memory-Resident Malware
- **Characteristics**: Operates entirely in memory without writing files to the disk.
- **Example**: Fileless worms that propagate through network connections and remain in the RAM of infected systems.

### 2. Script-Based Malware
- **Characteristics**: Uses scripts (e.g., PowerShell, JavaScript, VBScript) to execute malicious activities.
- **Example**: Malicious PowerShell scripts embedded in phishing emails or documents.

### 3. Registry-Resident Malware

# Malware Analysis

## Overview
**malware analysis**, which includes the stages of discovery, study, and reporting. Malware analysis starts with **discovery** — the process of detecting whether malware exists in a system. 

## Discovery Phase
1. **Initial Detection**: Malware discovery may be triggered by **antivirus (AV)**, **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** systems, or user reports of suspicious activity.
2. **Indicators of Infection**: 
   - Files with strange behavior (e.g., ransomware locking files).
   - AV or IDS/IPS systems detecting unusual activities like command and control (C2) connections.
   - User complaints such as unexpected system behavior or ransom notes.

3. **Sheep Dipping**:
   - The process of scanning and disinfecting infected devices (referred to as "cyber sheep").
   - AV and monitoring systems like network traffic analysis are used to check for suspicious activity.
   - Quarantined devices undergo thorough analysis before being allowed back into the network.

## Study/Analysis Phase
1. **Static Analysis**: This involves analyzing the file without executing it:
   - **File Hashing**: Files are hashed (e.g., using `md5sum`), and hashes are checked against known virus signatures in services like **VirusTotal**.
   - **File Type Identification**: Tools like `file` help identify file formats (e.g., ELF for Linux, PE for Windows).
   - **Suspicious Strings**: Searching for human-readable text strings within the code (e.g., `bin sh` could indicate a shell process).
   - **Obfuscation Detection**: Malware often obfuscates its code to avoid detection by AV systems.

2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Involves running the malware to observe its behavior:
   - **File System Behavior**: What files does it create or modify? Does it delete files or consume system resources (e.g., CPU, memory)?
   - **Network Activity**: Monitoring for any network traffic indicating command and control (C2) communication or data exfiltration.
   - **System Calls**: Tools like **S-trace** can trace system calls and monitor what resources the malware requests from the operating system.

## Tools and Techniques
- **VirusTotal**: A popular service for scanning files by their hash against multiple antivirus engines.
- **Hybrid Analysis**: Similar to VirusTotal, offering insights into file behaviors.
- **S-trace**: Useful for tracking system calls during dynamic analysis to detect what resources are being accessed.
- **IDAPRO/Ghidra**: Reverse engineering tools used for deeper analysis of malware code.

## Important Concepts
- **Obfuscation**: Malware may use techniques like Base64 encoding or PowerShell obfuscation to avoid detection.
- **Sandboxing**: Running malware in an isolated environment is essential to prevent it from affecting real systems. It's important to use either physical isolation or virtualization to safely analyze potentially dangerous files.

## Conclusion
Malware analysis involves **static** (examining files without running them) and **dynamic** (observing the malware's behavior while it runs) methods. Understanding both aspects helps security professionals detect, analyze, and prepare defenses against malware threats.
