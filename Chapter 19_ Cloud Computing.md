# Cloud Computing Overview

## Introduction
- Cloud computing is integral to modern technology.
- The cloud is essentially "someone else's computer."

## Types of Cloud Services
1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
   - Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
   - Users manage applications, data, runtime, middleware, and OS.
   - Providers manage virtualization, servers, storage, and networking.

2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
   - Offers hardware and software tools over the internet.
   - Users manage applications and data.
   - Providers handle runtime, middleware, OS, virtualization, servers, storage, and networking.

3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**
   - Delivers software applications over the internet.
   - Providers manage all aspects of the service.
   - Example: Google Suite (Gmail, Google Docs, etc.).

4. **IDaaS (Identity as a Service)**
   - Manages user identities and access.
   - Includes single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

5. **SECaaS (Security as a Service)**
   - Provides security services via the cloud.
   - Includes automated penetration testing, antivirus (AV), and endpoint detection and response (EDR).

6. **CaaS (Container as a Service)**
   - Offers container-based virtualization.
   - Example: Amazon S3 buckets and other container services.

7. **FaaS (Function as a Service)**
   - Enables functions to be executed in the cloud.
   - Example: AWS Lambda.

## Responsibility Areas
- **On-premises:** User is responsible for all aspects of infrastructure and software.
- **IaaS:** Provider handles physical aspects and virtualization; user handles software and data.
- **PaaS:** Provider manages everything except applications and data.
- **SaaS:** Provider manages all aspects of the service.

## Deployment Models
1. **Public Cloud**
   - Services offered over the public internet and available to anyone.
   
2. **Private Cloud**
   - Exclusive to a single organization, offering more control and security.

3. **Community Cloud**
   - Shared among multiple organizations with common concerns.
   - Example: Healthcare providers sharing infrastructure for secure data exchange.

4. **Hybrid Cloud**
   - Combination of public, private, and community cloud models.

5. **Multi-Cloud**
   - Utilizes services from multiple cloud providers for redundancy or specialized capabilities.
   - Managed through a single interface by third-party brokers.

## NIST Cloud Deployment Reference Architecture
1. **Cloud Consumer**:
   - End user or organization using the cloud service.

2. **Cloud Provider**:
   - Entity providing cloud services.

3. **Cloud Carrier**:
   - Enables network connectivity between consumers and providers.

4. **Cloud Broker**:
   - Manages and integrates multiple cloud services for consumers.

5. **Cloud Auditor**:
   - Conducts independent assessments of cloud implementations.

## Cloud Storage Architecture
1. **Front-End**:
   - User-facing interaction layer (e.g., APIs, web apps).

2. **Back-End**:
   - Physical hardware (servers, networking).

3. **Middleware**:
   - Handles data deduplication, replication, and storage efficiency.


## Categories of Cloud Brokers
1. **Service Intermediation**
   - **Description:** Enhances an existing service by improving specific capabilities.
   - **Example:** A broker might add security features to a basic cloud storage service, providing encryption and access control that the original service lacks.

2. **Service Aggregation**
   - **Description:** Combines multiple services into one unified service. It handles data integration and ensures the services work together seamlessly.
   - **Example:** A broker could integrate cloud storage from one provider, computing power from another, and database services from a third into a single package.

3. **Service Arbitrage**
   - **Description:** Provides flexibility in choosing services from multiple providers based on current conditions and requirements. The broker evaluates and selects the best options dynamically.
   - **Example:** A broker might switch between cloud providers for the best price or performance for a specific task, such as shifting from AWS to Azure if Azure offers a better rate or performance for a given workload.

**Key Takeaway**: Cloud computing provides various service and deployment models, each with unique responsibility areas, enabling flexibility and scalability for different needs.

# Container Basics
- **Definition:** A container is a portable software package that includes everything needed to run an application, such as configuration files, libraries, and dependencies. This ensures consistency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.
- **Advantages:** Containers simplify the development process by providing predefined environments, reducing setup time, and ensuring applications run consistently across different platforms.

## Five-Tier Container Architecture (as defined by EC-Council)
1. **Developer Machines**:
   - Used for image creation, testing, and accreditation.
   - Ensures the image is ready for use.

2. **Testing and Accreditation Systems**:
   - Verifies and validates image contents.
   - Signs the images for integrity and readiness.

3. **Registries**:
   - Stores container images.
   - Supports image delivery via orchestration software.

4. **Orchestrators**:
   - Transforms images into containers and deploys them.
   - Manages large-scale container deployments programmatically.

5. **Hosts**:
   - Operate and manage containers based on orchestrator instructions.

## Key Terms and Concepts
- **Docker**:
  - A leading platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications.
  - Features:
    - Docker Images: Base templates for creating containers.
    - Docker Daemon: Manages Docker objects and handles API requests.
    - Docker Registry (e.g., Docker Hub): Repository for official and custom container images.
    - Docker Files: Text files with commands for creating container images.

- **Orchestration**:
  - Automates the container lifecycle, including:
    - Provisioning and deployment.
    - Resource allocation and scaling.
    - Security and monitoring.

## Security Challenges in Containerization
1. **Untrusted Images**:
   - Public containers may contain outdated software or vulnerabilities.
   - Perform thorough checks before deployment.

2. **Container Breakout**:
   - Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities to escape the container and access the host system.
   - Running containers as root increases risks.

3. **Insecure Secrets**:
   - API keys, usernames, and passwords stored insecurely in containers can be exploited.

4. **Noisy Neighbor**:
   - A container consuming excessive host resources can cause other containers to fail.

5. **Vulnerable Source Code**:
   - Containers used for testing may expose organizations to attacks if insecure code is deployed.

## Key Takeaways
- Containers simplify development by bundling all necessary components into a portable format.
- Security diligence is crucial when using third-party containers or deploying at scale.
- Tools like Docker and Kubernetes streamline containerization and orchestration processes.
- Containers are not bucketsâ€”though both can "contain" items, they serve distinct purposes in technology.
